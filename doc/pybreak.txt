1. installation                                            *PYBREAKinstallation*

Prefered way of installing this plugin (as with any other script) is by 
installing it as a git submodule, and loading it with pathogen (for pathogen
installation instructions, please refer to https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen
or http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2332). When you have
pathogen installed, installin pybreak is as simple as: >

    git clone git://github.com/nthorne/vim-pybreak.git bundle/pybreak
<

2. usage                                                          *PYBREAKusage*

<localleader>d, where <localleader> defaults to \\, inserts a set_trace
statement after the cursor position, if no statements are found on the current
line. If, however, any set_trace statements (as inserted by pybreak) are found
anywhere on the current line, they are removed, and no set_trace statements are
inserted. \<localleader\>da removes all set\_trace statements in the entire
active buffer.
